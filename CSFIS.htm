			<p>The <strong><a href="https://www2.mmu.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/2018/15393/#indepth">’Computer Systems Fundamentals’</a></strong> unit 
			proffers an all-encompassing introduction to the rudimentary principles and mathematics underpinning the design and construction of computer 
			systems. Topics in the unit include: Digital Logic & Boolean Algebra, Assembly Language Programming Discrete Mathematics, Set Algebra, Functions 
			and Logic.</p>
			<p>Recently, in the Computer Systems Fundamentals unit, we undertook an MCQ (multiple-choice question) test including the use of <strong><a href=
			"http://www.cburch.com/logisim/">‘LogiSim’</a></strong> to design & simulate digital logic circuits, which was 25% of the overall unit; assessing 
			our competence in the content covered in the first 5 weeks of Computer Systems Fundamentals lectures and in-class lab exercises, e.g.:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Digital Logic <em>(gates & circuits, Karnaugh maps and Fetch execute cycle)</em></li>
				<li>Boolean Algebra <em>(sum of product notation)</em></li>
				<li>ALU <em>(1-bit arithmetic & logic unit, full & half adder and decoder)</em></li>
				<li>Set Algebra <em>(set theory, subsets and laws)</em></li>
				<li>Discrete Mathematics <em>(matrices and vectors)</em></li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>In relation to my individual performance in the Computer Systems Fundamentals unit, I believe that I have attained widespread knowledge of the 
			unit hitherto and have faith that it will be reflected in the recent MCQ test. Particularly within this unit, the ability to attend ‘Drop-In’ 
			sessions with any chosen tutor following the confirmation of their availability is highly beneficial as one-to-one teaching/learning often move 
			at a pace dictated by the student and their needs, increasing the likelihood that the student will understand the content being covered. 
			Nevertheless, this is not limited to the Computer Systems Fundamentals unit; as ‘Drop-In’ sessions are available for all units with tutors that 
			specialise in the unit to ensure students are supported in their endeavours. Shown above is an ALU (Arithmetic & Logic Unit) which performs 
			arithmetic and logic operations. The three main components of a 1-bit ALU is a: (1) full adder, (2) logic unit, and (3) 2-to-4 decoder. 
			The purpose of the 2-to-4 decoder is to generate enable signals for the 4 operations based on the control signals.</p>

		<h2>Information Systems</h2> <!--'h2' element defines a heading in the document-->
			<img src="E-Portfolio Images/IS.jpg" alt="Image of a group of words related to the 'Information Systems' unit" width="27.5%" height="15%"/>
			<p>The <strong><a href="https://www2.mmu.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/2018/15393/#indepth">’Information Systems’</a></strong> unit introduces 
			the use of information systems in organisations; illustrating methods to develop essential system analysis techniques to be applied to information 
			systems built on a commercial Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), all whilst ameliorating communication & teamwork skills. Topics in 
			the unit include: the use of information systems for the management of information, business operations and data processing, business activities 
			(including case studies & examples), E-commerce theory, UML use cases, database management, design & development (ERDs & SQL).</p>
			<p>Recently, in the Information Systems unit, we congregated into groups of 3-6 and began Part 1 of the IS & DB (Information Systems & Databases) 
			Project, in which we co-operatively completed several tasks. The first part of the project is worth 10% of the overall unit’s mark; evaluating our 
			knowledge of Information Systems & Databases. Part 1 included:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Disadvantages of Ray’s Rentals’ (Case Study) current paper-based system</li>
				<li>System requirements for a proposed new computerised database system</li>
				<li>Comprehensive description of both <em>‘Data Enquiries’ & ‘Management Reports’</em></li>
				<li>Several possible Data Enquiries & Management Reports of use to Ray’s Rentals</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In regard to my personal performance in the Information Systems unit, I believe that it is my weakest unit, attributable to my uninterest in 
			the subject largely due to the continuous application of business-related studies, i.e. S.W.O.T Analysis, Systems Design Lifecycle (SDLC), Use 
			Case Diagrams (UCDs) and Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs). In comparison to heavy focus on coding (Java, HTML & CSS) in the Programming and 
			Introduction to Web Design & Development units. Consequently, in order to become more comfortable in the Information Systems unit, I believe more 
			time ought to be allocated towards revision of this unit via ‘Drop-In’ sessions, Moodle, etc.</p>
			<p>Moodle is a learning platform designed to provide educators, administrators and learners with a single integrated system to create personalised 
			learning environments. It is arguably one of, if not the most useful methods of revision for students as the platform has extensive resources 
			available, i.e. past lab exercises, lecture slides/notes and videocasts in addition to self-directed study links for users to access wherever & 
			whenever due to its web-based design. As a result, revision isn’t limited by time-constraints or location.</p>
