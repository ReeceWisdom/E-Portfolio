		<h2>Work Experience</h2> <!--'h2' element defines a heading in the document-->
			<img src="E-Portfolio Images/CV.jpg" alt="Cartoon-style image of a CV (Curriculum Vitae)" width="27.5%" height="20%"/>
			<p>The knowledge I have acquired over the years is not limited to school and university work. During my first year of studying A-levels, I 
			was able to secure a work experience placement at the local charity shop, ‘Mind’. I developed my organisational and time management skills; 
			handling customers, stock and various other tasks. This alien experience taught me the importance of planning ahead as it enabled me to better 
			prepare for unexpected occurrences and handle them adequately. I have participated in several after-school events, including some that were 
			created to provide younger students considering studying A-levels with a better understanding of what to expect from A-level subjects from a 
			student's perspective.</p>
			<p>In addition to spending time on both studying and extracurricular activities, I am conscious of the significance of having time to relax. 
			One of my hobbies that I try to make time and pursue is playing football. As a child and still today, I greatly enjoy playing football as it 
			relieves worry of daily stressors. Additionally, it has assisted me in developing leadership traits as it has made me more inclined to adopt 
			a ‘team mindset’.</p>

			<table border = "1">
				<tr>
					<th><strong>Criteria</strong></th>
					<th><strong>Rating</strong> <em>(0 – 5)</em></th>
					<th><strong>Explanation</strong></th>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td id="Criteria">Critical Thinking & Problem Solving</td>
					<td id="Rating">4</td>
					<td id="Explanation">Critical thinking is debatably one of, if not the most important criterion of personal attributes in relation to 
					an individual’s employability; encompassing objective analysis & evaluation to form a robust judgement. I believe this aspect of my 
					personal attributes are well-developed, shown in my ability to behave rationally & logically in situations, ensuring the final outcome 
					is unbiased & objective as opposed to subjective.<br><br>Problem solving in relation to Computer Science, notably the Programming and 
					Web Design & Development unit, repeatedly requires creative approaches to resolve issues that arise. This is one aspect which I wish to 
					improve as it will greatly aid not only for duration of my degree, but also within the workplace.</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td id="Criteria">Professionalism</td>
					<td id="Rating">4.5</td>
					<td id="Explanation">Professionalism is expected of both students & employees whilst at university or work. In regard to my level of 
					professionalism, it is partially reflected in my attendance at university – 93%; which is high in comparison to other students’ 
					attendance percentages. Furthermore, my professionalism is also illustrated in my attempts avoid conversating during lectures, lab sessions 
					and other circumstances. Overall, I believe I act, more often than not, in a professional manner, however, it could be improved (occurring 
					more frequently).</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td id="Criteria">Communication Skills</td>
					<td id="Rating">3</td>
					<td id="Explanation">Communication in relation to the ability to convey/share ideas and feelings effectively is essential within the 
					workplace and particularly in the Information Systems unit, as it’s 65% group-related coursework. Regarding communicative skills, I 
					display demonstrate clarity & concision, reducing the likelihood that the listener(s) will be confused or misinterpret information 
					conveyed. Nevertheless, one improvement of my communication skills may include becoming more open-minded so I can consider new ideas; 
					unprejudiced.</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td id="Criteria">Teamwork & Leadership</td>
					<td id="Rating">2.5</td>
					<td id="Explanation">Although I understand the importance of teamwork within both the workplace and university, especially in the 
					Information Systems unit, as it’s 65% group-related coursework. I loathe the concept that my coursework and ultimately my final grade 
					will be partially dependent on someone else’s ability/work. Nonetheless, I aim to improve my teamwork skills as working as a collective 
					develops a system which allows multiple tasks to be completed efficiently, effectively and simultaneously.</td>

		<h2>Career Aspirations</h2> <!--'h2' element defines a heading in the document-->
			<p>Regarding my personal goals, in spite of the fact that the first-year grade does not count towards the Computer Science degree’s final grade and 
			the pass rate is only 40%, I endeavour to achieve minimum of 70% in the first year as it is well-established that the graduate employment market is 
			competitive. Figures from the <strong><a href=https://www.hesa.ac.uk/>HESA (Higher Education Statistic Agency)</a></strong> shows that in 2011, almost 
			1-in-6 undergraduates at UK universities achieved a first. As a result, attaining high grades throughout the degree’s duration is crucial as it 
			contributes in ‘standing out from the crowd’ (other Computer Science graduates).</p>
			<p>In relation to post-graduate job prospects, although I am have not decided upon a definitive occupation I wish to pursue, the <strong>
			<a href=”https://www.prospects.ac.uk/careers-advice/what-can-i-do-with-my-degree/computer-science”>Graduate Prospects</a></strong> website provides a 
			wide-ranging selection of Computer Science related professions, e.g. ‘Application Analyst’, ‘Database Administrator’, ‘Games Developer’, ‘Information 
			Systems Manager', ‘IT Consultant’, ‘Web Designer/Developer’, etc.</p>
