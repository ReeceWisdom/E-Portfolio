			<p>The underpinning theme of the <strong><a href="https://www2.mmu.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/2018/15393/#indepth">
			'Introduction to Web Design and Development’</a></strong> unit is the efficient design & development of effective and robust websites 
			for the range of popular platforms using the most modern technologies and techniques. Topics in the unit include: client-server model, 
			web standards, HTML5 (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheet), JavaScript & PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor).</p>
			<p>Currently, in the Introduction to Web Design and Development unit, we are developing a personal e-portfolio website, styled with an 
			external style sheet using <strong><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">‘Notepad ++’</strong></a>, which is 25% of the overall unit; 
			demonstrating our understanding of HTML & CSS and the skills acquired in lectures, in-class lab exercises/worksheets and self-directed 
			study time, e.g.:</p>
			
			<ul> <!--unordered list-->
				<li>HTML5 Semantic Elements/Tags <em>(body, h1, p, br, a href, img src, etc.)</em></a> <!--'li' element defines a list item-->
				<li>CSS Tags <em>(margin & padding, font-size, color, float, border, etc.)</em></a>
				<li>CSS3 <em>(transition, 2D/3D transformations, animations, text effects)</em></a>
				<li>Usability & Accessibility</a>
				<li>Media Queries & Responsive Stylesheets</a>
			</ul>
			
			<p>In relation to my personal performance in the Introduction to Web Design and Development unit, I believe that I have a comprehensive 
			understanding of the unit thus far and feel it will be reflected in the Part A of the E-Portfolio. One website which is of great aid whilst 
			coding within both HTML and CSS is the third-party website <strong><a href="https://w3schools.com">W3Schools</a></strong>. It provides tutorials, 
			examples and references for both HTML and CSS on how to design and develop a website which is advantageous as one can revisit or learn and 
			understand elements and how to implement them effectively and correctly. However, it is not always wise to rely on third-party websites for 
			HTML or CSS code because it may be deemed as plagiarism and may recommend an inefficient and/or ineffective method of coding, which may cause 
			individuals to lose marks if used within coursework. For example, if searching how to create a navigation menu/bar within HTML or CSS, a 
			website may suggest implementing a ‘div’ element opposed to the ‘nav’ element which is commonly used in HTML5.</p>

		<h2>Programming</h2> <!--'h2' element defines a heading in the document-->
			<img src="E-Portfolio Images/Programming.jpg" alt="Image of programming-related code" width="27.5%" height="15%"/>
			 <p>The <strong><a href="https://www2.mmu.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/2018/15393/#indepth">‘Programming’</a></strong> unit is 
			 arguably one of, if not the most important aspect of the Computer Science degree due to its use as a basis, supporting several latter units. 
			 Programming entails computer programming in a high-level programming language (Java) using <strong><a href="https://processing.org/">
			 ‘Processing’</strong></a>, principles in troubleshooting errors, practice in logical thinking, development of problem solving & solution 
			 implementation skills and program design.</p>
			<p>Recently, in the Programming unit, we undertook an MCQ (multiple-choice question) and code writing test, which was 20% of the overall unit; 
			examining our understanding of the content covered in the first 5 weeks of Programming lectures and in-class lab exercises, e.g.:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Commands <em>(point, ellipse, line, rect, stroke, etc.)</em></a>
				<li>Global & Local Variables <em>(int/float)</em></a>
				<li>Scalable Variables <em>(int x, int y, int size)</em></a>
				<li>For & Nested For Loops</a>
				<li>Procedures <em>(void setup(), void draw(), etc.)</em></a>
				<li>Design Methodology <em>(top-down design, code refinement, etc.)</em></a>
				<li>Conditional If & Nested If Statements</a>
			</ul>
			
			<p>In regard to my individual performance in the Programming unit, I believe that I have acquired an extensive comprehension of the unit 
			thus far and have confidence that it will be reflected in the recent MCQ test. For this unit, the ability to participate in weekly formative 
			quizzes, testing our knowledge of Programming is an extremely useful tool as it allows for self-assessment of my understanding with the content 
			covered in lectures and in-class lab exercises. Another practice of great use within this unit is the use of pseudo-code (describing a set of 
			instructions with no specific syntax) to plan and create solutions for errors encountered whilst programming. However, pseudo-code is not 
			exclusive to problem solving, it is also useful when developing a program, allowing the desired ends to be defined in-depth or superficially 
			prior to beginning the task.</p>
